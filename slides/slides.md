# What was the problem

Building a new simple, ad-free music player can be beneficial for several reasons:

1. **User Experience**: Ads can be intrusive and disrupt the listening experience. A simple, ad-free music player ensures that users can enjoy their music without interruptionsÂ¹.

2. **Privacy**: Some music players with ads may require internet permissions to fetch ads, which could potentially compromise user privacy. An ad-free player that doesn't require internet access can offer a more private experienceÂ¹.

3. **Performance**: Without the need to load ads, a simple music player can be more lightweight and have faster performance, especially on devices with limited resourcesÂ¹.
   In summary, a new simple, ad-free music player can offer a more enjoyable, private, and efficient way to listen to music, with a focus on the features that matter most to users.
